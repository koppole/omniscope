SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
This peptide shows very low stability overall.

Recommendations to improve stability:
1. Consider mutating high-energy residues to more favorable amino acids.
2. The peptide has low secondary structure content. Consider adding helix or sheet stabilizing residues.
3. Several residues have unfavorable backbone geometry. Redesign these regions or add stabilizing interactions.
